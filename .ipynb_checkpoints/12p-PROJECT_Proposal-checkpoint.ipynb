    "\n",
    "Financial markets are complex systems that are influenced by a number of factors. Because of this, making accurate stock price predictions is a challenging task. Despite this, quant firms such as Jane Street Capital and Two Sigma leverage powerful trading algorithms to allow for highly accurate stock market predictions. \n",
    "\n",
    "In an effort to understand how these quant firms see such unparalleled levels of success, I aim to explore tools such as TensorFlow and Python Numba to make stock price predictions based on historic stock price data. I aim to benchmark the model's accuracy, training time between GPU-accelerated TensorFlow and CPU-based training, inference speed, and computational improvements through Python Numba optimizations.\n",
    "\n",
    "I hope to accelerate operations such as moving averages and standard deviations using Numba, model training time using TensorFlow's GPU capabilities, and prediction computation. A successful outcome from this project would be developing a model with 50% or greater accuracy that outperforms baseline methods. Additionally, a demonstration of significant reduction in computation time for model training and prediction would also be considered a success.\n"

    "\n",
    "For this project, I aim to explore TensorFlow for machine learning-based time series forecasting, and Python Numba for computational optimization. I chose TensorFlow because it provides an efficient framework for training and deploying machine learning models, which is pivotal to the project since we will be comparing the effectiveness of different models. Since I am relatively new to TensorFlow, I will be using documentation listed in the TensorFlow Core as my starting point for setting up the time series forecasting. I will also be using the Python Numba documentation as a starting point for optimizing my model's computation and training time.\n",
    "\n",
    "This process will consist of setting up a TensorFlow environment with GPU acceleration to improve model training speed, then I will implement feature engineering techniques to ensure that the dataset is structured for efficient model training. Once these steps have been complete, I plan on using the MSU HPCC to run and test my code against large-scale financial datasets. The expected outcome that I hope to see is a fully functional TensorFlow model, an optimized financial feature engineering functions through Python Numba, and a well structured repository with clear documentation outlining my process and the instructions for reproducing my results.\n",

    "For benchmarking, I will evaluate model training time, inference speed, and computational efficiency. Specifically, I will be benchmarking CPU vs. GPU training time, with the goal of comparing how much faster TensorFlow can train a model on a GPU vs. a CPU. I will also be comparing the performance of Numba vs. the performance of standard Python functions, with the hope of seeing improvements from using Numba-accelerated feature calculations as opposed to using only Python. And finally, I will be benchmarking parallel processing in TensorFlow, with the goal of investigating whether multi-threading or vectorized computations can further optimize the models.\n",

    "- Reduce model training time on a GPU by a factor of 5x or more compared to CPU-based training\n",
