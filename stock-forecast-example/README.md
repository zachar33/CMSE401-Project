# Stock Forecasting with Prophet

This project evaluates the open-source time series forecasting tool **Prophet**, developed by Facebook. It is widely used in scientific and financial applications for analyzing and predicting future trends using time series data.

Prophet is a programming tool, built as a Python library, designed to handle time series with strong seasonal effects and historical trends. In this project, we demonstrate its use in forecasting stock market prices using historical stock data downloaded via the `yfinance` library.
